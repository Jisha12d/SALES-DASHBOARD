# SALES-DASHBOARD
This project examines a Pizza Sales Dataset that includes order dates, times, types of pizza, sizes, quantities, prices, and revenue. It reveals customer purchasing behaviors, identifies the categories of pizzas that are best and least sold, and emphasizes significant sales trends on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis for business insights.
